E-commerce Sales Dashboard (2009–2011) | Power BI Project

I created a dashboard to analyze 3 years of sales data for an e-commerce business. This helped me uncover valuable trends, top-performing products, and sales patterns.

🔍 Key Insights:
📦 Total Quantity Sold: 12M+ units
💰 Total Sales: ₹20.81 Million
🛒 Total Orders: 42,000
🧾 Average Order Value: ₹495.48

🏆 Top Products by Revenue:
REGENCY CAKESTAND 3 TIER – ₹3.44L
Manual – ₹3.40L (likely a non-product/service)
DOTCOM POSTAGE – ₹3.22L (likely operational)

📈 Sales peaked in Q4 (Oct–Dec) each year, showing strong seasonal demand.
 🌍 United Kingdom made up 85%+ of total sales. Germany, Netherlands, and Ireland show strong potential for growth.

🛠️ Tools Used:
Power BI Desktop
DAX for custom KPIs
Time, product, and regional analysis
Slicers, KPI cards, bar/line/donut charts
